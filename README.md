# Puzzles
A place for my Codewars puzzles

I find that it's tough to troubleshoot the harder code on the Codewars site
due to the ms warnings.  Sometimes I need the code to run to completion to
figure out if there are any unwanted bugs, even if it runs longer than 6000ms.
Then I can refactor from there.  Sooooooo here's my repo to tweak and update
the harder code on CW :).
